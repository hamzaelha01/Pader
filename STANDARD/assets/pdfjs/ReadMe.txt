Hi !
I am worked With PDFjs To Show and save files as PDF , the 2 first files are for library and the third is for functions used in your HTML

1- Include Them in your index.html
2- Keep the same names of functions noticed in pdfFromHTML.js

NB: The first file make error with scroll library so you disable it and it workd Fine :)
